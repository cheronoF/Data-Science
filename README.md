Hypothyroidism Prediction

Overview

Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:

a) Defining the Question

Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

b) Metric for Success

Clean dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis

Decision Trees - Random Forest, Ada Boost, Gradient Boost

SVM - rbf, sigmoid, polynomial functions

c) Validating the data

Challenge the solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements in model improvement.

d) Experimental Design

Data preparation

Data analysis

Data modeling
